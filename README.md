## Environment secrets

Secrets live in this repo **encrypted** with [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) + [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age):
`env/enc/<dev|prod>.env.enc` is committed; `just env-use <name>` decrypts it to
`env/dec/<name>.env` (gitignored, mode 0600) and symlinks `./.env` to it. The
Nix dev shell provides the tooling, `just env-audit` runs keyless in CI, and
containers decrypt at `docker run` — never at build. See [`env/README.md`](env/README.md).
